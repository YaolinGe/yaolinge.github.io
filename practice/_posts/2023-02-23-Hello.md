# A good start

Recently I have been trying out different tools to write a blog and setting up my personal webpage. 

### Tools 
- `jekyll`: static site generator, very useful, can convert markdown to the page files. 
- `html`: basic building blocks for making a webpage. 
- `css`: the styling sheet. 
- `javascript`: the interaction logic. 
- `ruby`: the framework
- `flask`

## Interesting facts
I have made DALL.E draw the railway to the moon. Here is what I got, which is very interesting!!!
