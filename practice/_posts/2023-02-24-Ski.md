# Morning
Today is Friday, I woke up late since recently I have been very tired and my whole body felt exhausted. According to my doctor, I have to remain using my glasses until the day which is next Thursday to do the survey on the eyes. Speaking of the eye surgery, Natoya just told me about the health care system in Norway. I believe I should check with Tekna for more information about the insurance reinbursement so that I can save a lot of money for other things. 

# Afternoon
I had some chat with Andre about the forthcoming tests in Nidelva and the paper writing, hopefully we will collaborate with on the paper writing. 

# Evening
I finally established my routine to go skiing every Friday and train on my techniques. 

# Night at 22 at my office
I enjoyed the peace time and rewinding my day about the future plans.
