# Notes for learning Jekyll

`jekyll new myblog` will create a bundle in the folder `myblog` including essential components for building a static website.
`cd myblog`
`bundle exec jekyll serve` to launch the website on the server.


`_config.yml` can be used to adjust the template for the website, so one can change the title and description for the desired needs.
