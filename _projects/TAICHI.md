TAICHI stands for Twined Autonomous Informative Cooperative Hotspot Inquiry system. The project is a collaboration between NTNU and SINTEF Ocean. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway through the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project.

The project is a sub-project under the umbrella of the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project. The goal of the project is to develop a system that can autonomously detect and investigate hotspots in the ocean using two or more agents simultaneously.
