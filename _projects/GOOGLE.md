GOOGLE stands for GOOd GLobal Extended-horizon path planning for adaptive sampling using autonomous underwater vehicles. 

The project is a sub-project under the umbrella of the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project. The goal of the project is to develop a path planning algorithm that can be used to plan paths for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a global sense. The algorithm should be able to plan paths that are long enough to cover a large area, but also be able to adapt to changes in the environment. The algorithm should also be able to plan paths that are safe for the AUV to follow.

The project is a collaboration between NTNU and SINTEF Ocean. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway through the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project.
