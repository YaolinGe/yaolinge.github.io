MAFIA stands for Martin's Flexible anIsotropic spAtial model.

The project is a sub-project under the umbrella of the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project. The goal of the project is to develop a flexible anisotropic spatial model that can be used to model the spatial distribution of a given quantity. The model should be able to model the spatial distribution of a quantity in a flexible manner, and should be able to model the spatial distribution of a quantity in an anisotropic manner. The model should also be able to model the spatial distribution of a quantity in a spatially varying manner.

The project is a collaboration between NTNU and SINTEF Ocean. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway through the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project.
