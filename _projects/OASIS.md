OASIS stands for Oceanographic Autonomous Statistical Intelligent Sampling. The project is a collaboration between NTNU and SINTEF Ocean. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway through the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project.

The project is a sub-project under the umbrella of the [MASCOT](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/mascot) project. The goal of the project is to develop a statistical sampling system that can autonomously sample the ocean using a single agent.
