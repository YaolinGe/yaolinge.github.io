I like to chase the northern light in my camping career. Whenever it is nice weather and high probability to see the northern light, I would not hestitate to camp outdoor to view the northern light. I have been to many places to chase the northern light, including Troms√∏, Trondheim, Lofoten.

Feel free to reach me out if you wanna join the fabulous trip once in a while.
